# Capital_cost_classifier-Naive-Bayes
A simple naive bayes algorithm to classify manufacturing sector capital cost 


This project intends to apply the naive bayes algorithm on a basis that shows three variables of the US manufacturing sector.
The first variable corresponds to the product (added value) in thousands of dollars in manufacturing sector.
The second one is total time worked in thousands of hours
and the third variable is a capital expenditure in thousands of dollars.
The main objetive is to predict a classification for capital expenditure when two predictors variables (added value and total time
worked) are above or below its averages.

I've transcribed this database from this book: Basics Econometrics,
page 224 (Gujarati, Damodar. Porter, Dawn C. Published by Irwin/McGraw-Hill; 5th Revised ed.
ISBN-10:0073375772). This table it's in the file "Source table in Excel.xlsx".
They capture all data in this source: 2005 Annual Survey of Manufacturers, Setor 31: Supplemental Statistics for U.S.

A second table (modeled source.xlsx) was prepared to calculate average for both variables
and I classified them all 'above' (the average) or 'below'. I created this one to justified where
I found those classes.

The third file 'modeled_data.csv ' is used to apply naive bayes algorithm.

This project was useful because it is my first project added in GitHub and a startup in my journey through machine learning
models.

To run this project in your IDE you can import all requirements into your compiler (all packages are in "requirements.txt").

Thank you
